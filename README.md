- What was your motivation?

- In this project we are building a brand marketing site. This site will help users understand concepts for success in media marketing over various online mediums . 

- We see that there are a few errors in this code. In this project we will be refactoring this already existing code.
    There are errors within the html semantics. so we will be switching up some tags to follow proper html structure by changing tags. 
    Fixing up other various errors within the html and css file.

- In this project I learned the proper Html and css structuring, how to look and identify bugs within tag attributes and css files. I also got a good idea of navigating thorugh the file system to properly link different files of different locations together. Github was another topic in which this project has helped
to get a great understanding of and the process of pushing/puling code.
